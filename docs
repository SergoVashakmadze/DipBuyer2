@DipBuyer – an AI agent to identify, analyze and automatically invest in undervalued investment opportunities.
Task: Develop an AI-Powered Undervalued Asset Buying Agent "DipBuyer". This agent will focus on identifying potentially undervalued financial assets (stocks, ETFs, indexes, REITs, crypto currencies) and presenting a user-friendly interface for configuration, analysis, buying, selling, adding and withdrawing funds. The agent will leverage the Coinbase Developer Platform (CDP) Agentkit for onchain functionalities related to crypto assets including buying and selling including Coinbase wallet integration. 
Core Functionality:
    1. Simulated Undervaluation Identification:
        ◦ Implement a basic algorithm to simulate the identification of and investment in undervalued assets. 
        ◦ Utilize data sourced via the Coinbase AgentKit and the TradingView API (or other reliable free/simulated data sources if direct TradingView API access is too complex). For crypto/digital assets, prioritize data and actions available through the CDP Agentkit. 
        ◦ Allow users to define a percentage threshold for undervaluation. 
    2. Investment Logic:
        ◦ Implement a simplified logic for "investing" in identified undervalued assets. 
        ◦ For crypto/digital assets, explore using CDP Agentkit to execute transactions and manage wallets.   
    3. Filtering and Selection:
        ◦ Enable users to filter simulated investment opportunities based on their budget, asset class (stocks, ETFs, crypto) and risk appetite. 
    4. Wallet:
        ◦ Implement a basic wallet and transaction history with date and time. 
        ◦ For crypto, integrate with the CDP Agentkit for wallet detection, connection/integration and management of onchain transaction history.   
    5. TradingView Widget Integration:
        ◦ Integrate the free TradingView ticker tape widget at the top of the page. 
        ◦ Integrate other relevant free TradingView charting widgets to display asset price data and facilitate basic analysis. 
    6. Investment Analysis Elements:
        ◦ Display key data points for identified assets as part of the overall portfolio. 
    7. Learn
        ◦ Add a Learn tab with search field linked to Investopedia, investing.com, Cointelegraph and Yahoo Finance.
Technical Considerations:
    • UI/UX: Create visually appealing interface. Leverage TradingView widgets for market data visualization. 
    • Implement hover animations or mouse-based parallax effects to create a sense of smooth cursor movement. Try other techniques include dynamic menus, SVG animations, and hover animations, all of which can enhance the user experience by making navigation smoother and more intuitive. 
    • Add a Toggle Theme button that changes colour between dark and light.
    • TradingView Integration: Utilize TradingView's embeddable widgets for the ticker tape and charts. Explore the Coinbase and TradingView API for data retrieval if needed, keeping in mind potential limitations or costs for real-time data. 
    • Coinbase AgentKit Integration: 
        ◦ Utilize the CDP Agentkit for onchain operations related to crypto assets, such as: 
            ▪ Deploying tokens (ERC-20 & NFTs)   
            ▪ Managing wallets   
            ▪ Executing transactions   
            ▪ Interacting with smart contracts   
        ◦ Be aware of the need to handle API keys and wallet security.   
    • Simulation Environment: All investment activities (buying and selling) are within a simulated environment. 
Potential Challenges and Considerations:
    • Integrating TradingView widgets smoothly. 
    • Sourcing reliable data for the undervaluation simulation (prioritizing free or easily simulated data). 
    • Balancing functionality and presentation. 
    • Securely managing wallet data and API keys when using CDP Agentkit.   
Success Criteria (MVP):
    • A functional AI agent that simulates undervaluation identification. 
    • User interfaces with configurable parameters. 
    • Integration of TradingView ticker tape and charting widgets. 
    • A basic wallet and transaction history (with consideration for CDP AgentKit integration for crypto). 
    • Display of relevant asset data. 
    • Demonstrated use of CDP Agentkit for onchain crypto operations (if crypto functionality is implemented) including Coinbase wallet integration.

"The phrase "in the middle of difficulty lies opportunity" is often associated with the Chinese character for "crisis", which is 危机 (wēi jī). While the character 危 (wēi) translates to "danger," the character 机 (jī) is often interpreted as "opportunity" in this context, although its literal meaning is more about a crucial point or change. The phrase highlights the idea that challenges can also be opportunities for growth and change. Elaboration: 危机 (wēi jī): This Chinese phrase translates to "crisis" or "dangerous situation". 危 (wēi): This character means "danger," "to endanger," or "precarious". 机 (jī): While not directly meaning "opportunity," 机 (jī) can be interpreted as a crucial point, an inflection point, or a time of potential change, which is where opportunity may arise. It's the potential for something new to emerge, not just the immediate danger. John F. Kennedy's Quote: The famous quote "When written in Chinese, the word 'crisis' is composed of two characters—one represents danger, and the other represents opportunity" is often attributed to John F. Kennedy, though it's not a precise translation, it reflects the idea of opportunity within adversity."

Elaborate on the above with more information and quotes from highly reputable sources.

I understand that you want me to create a feature specification for an AI-Powered Undervalued Asset Buying Agent called "DipBuyer". I'll focus on the frontend requirements and user interface aspects, without going into backend details. The webapp should have a beautiful and modern UI, not minimalistic, with proper components and a well-thought-out color palette.
Here's what I want to create:
1. Main Dashboard:
- I want a visually appealing main dashboard that displays an overview of the user's portfolio, current market trends, and potential investment opportunities.
- The dashboard should include a TradingView ticker tape widget at the top, showing real-time market data.
- I need to implement a toggle theme button that switches between dark and light modes for the entire application.
2. Asset Identification and Analysis:
- I want to create a section where users can view potentially undervalued assets identified by the AI algorithm.
- Each asset should be displayed with key data points, including current price, historical performance, and potential upside.
- I need to integrate TradingView charting widgets to show detailed price charts and analysis for each asset.
3. Investment Configuration:
- I want to design an intuitive interface where users can set their investment preferences, including:
- Budget allocation
- Risk appetite
- Preferred asset classes (stocks, ETFs, crypto, indexes, REITs etc)
- Undervaluation threshold percentage
- The interface should use sliders, dropdown menus, and toggle switches for easy configuration.
4. Wallet and Transaction History:
- I need to create a wallet section that displays the user's current balance and transaction history.
- The transaction history should be presented in a clear, tabular format with date, time, asset, amount, and transaction type.
- I want to implement a feature to add or withdraw funds from the wallet.
5. Portfolio Management:
- I want to design a portfolio management section where users can view their current holdings, performance metrics, and asset allocation.
- This section should include interactive charts and graphs to visualize the portfolio's composition and performance over time.
6. Learn Tab:
- I need to create a dedicated "Learn" tab with a search field.
- The search results should display relevant articles from Investopedia, investing.com, Cointelegraph, and Yahoo Finance.
- I want to implement a clean and organized layout for displaying search results and article previews.
7. User Interface Enhancements:
- I want to implement hover animations and mouse-based parallax effects to create a sense of smooth cursor movement throughout the application.
- The UI should include dynamic menus and SVG animations to enhance the user experience and make navigation more intuitive.
8. Responsive Design:
- The webapp should not be responsive, but it should have a beautiful and modern UI with proper components and a well-thought-out color palette.
9. Coinbase Integration:
- I need to create a section for Coinbase wallet integration, allowing users to connect their Coinbase wallets to the application.
- This section should display the user's Coinbase wallet balance and transaction history.
10. Simulated Trading Environment:
- I want to design a simulated trading interface where users can execute buy and sell orders for identified undervalued assets.
- The interface should clearly indicate that all trading activities are simulated and not using real funds.
Remember, the focus should be on creating a visually appealing and user-friendly interface that allows users to easily navigate through the various features of the DipBuyer application. The UI should be modern, engaging, and intuitive, providing a seamless experience for users as they explore undervalued assets and manage their simulated investments.
