## Key Components

### Asset Identification

The system uses a combination of technical indicators, moving averages, and historical price patterns to identify potentially undervalued assets. The undervaluation score is calculated based on:

- Current price relative to historical moving averages
- Standard deviation from mean prices
- Recent price movements and volatility

### TradingView Integration

The application integrates TradingView widgets for professional-grade market data visualization:

- Ticker tape for real-time market updates
- Advanced charting capabilities with technical indicators
- Symbol search and analysis tools

### Wallet System

DipBuyer offers two wallet options:

1. **Simulation Wallet**: A virtual wallet for practicing investment strategies without real money
2. **Coinbase Wallet Integration**: Connect your Coinbase wallet for real crypto transactions (simulated in the current version)

### Portfolio Management

Track your investments with detailed analytics:

- Total portfolio value and performance metrics
- Asset allocation visualization
- Profit/loss tracking
- Transaction history

The application can be deployed to Vercel or any other hosting platform that supports Next.js applications.

### Deploying to Vercel

1. Push your code to a GitHub repository
2. Connect your repository to Vercel
3. Configure build settings if needed
